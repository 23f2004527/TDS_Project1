1. **HOW I SCRAPED MY FILE:**<br />
      * I used python pandas to create the csv file out of the json file <br />
      * I scraped the json file using my git api authorization key and a module called requests<br />
      * Which is generally used to make http requests to webservers<br />
      * The URL that i used to make a http request to fetch the json file was, "https://api.github.com/search/users", appending it with my git authorization key and the query of followers > 200.<br />
      * And once I had users.csv i did the same thing for repositries.csv<br />
      * I have the scrape.py file that i used to scrape all the data.<br />

2. **The most interesting and surprising fact you found after analyzing the the data:**<br />
      * The most intresting and surprising fact that i found was that most used programming language is JavaScript, I was always in the bubble of python, thinking this is the most used language, but for my surprise, most people are javascript developers!<br />

3. **An actionable recommendation for developers based on your analysis:**<br />
      * Leverage Popular Technologies such as JavaScript frameworks.<br />
      * Align with the Industry and technology trends.<br />
      * Engage with or follow top users like tiangolo, schacon, and rwieruch as they can provide valuable insights into best practices.<br />
      * Developers should familiarize themselves with these licenses.<br />

HOPE I DID A GOOD JOB ;)
