1. HOW I SCRAPED MY FILE:
      I used python pandas to create the csv file out of the json file 
      I scraped the json file using my git api authorization key and a module called requests
      Which is generally used to make http requests to webservers
      The URL that i used to make a http request to fetch the json file was, "https://api.github.com/search/users", appending it with my git authorization key and the query of followers > 200.
      And once I had users.csv i did the same thing for repositries.csv
      I have the scrape.py file that i used to scrape all the data.

2. The most interesting and surprising fact you found after analyzing the the data:
      The most intresting and surprising fact that i found was that most used programming language is JavaScript, I was always in the bubble of python, thinking this is the most used language, but for my surprise,
      most people are javascript developers!

3. An actionable recommendation for developers based on your analysis:
      Leverage Popular Technologies such as JavaScript frameworks.
      Align with the Industry and technology trends.
      Engage with or follow top users like tiangolo, schacon, and rwieruch as they can provide valuable insights into best practices.
      developers should familiarize themselves with these licenses.

HOPE I DID A GOOD JOB ;)
